Internship Project 

# CIFAR-10 Image Classification
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 distinct classes. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes include airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

# Introduction
This project demonstrates the development and training of a CNN for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to accurately classify images into their respective categories. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

# Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known benchmark for image classification. It contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
